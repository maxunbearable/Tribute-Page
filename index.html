        Best Marcus Aurelius quotes
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.
        </li>
        <li>
          The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
        </li>
        <li>
          Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.
        </li>
        <li>
          Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.
        </li>
        <li>
          Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.
        </li>
